# terminal-web-resume

Hello Everyone! My name is Joo Hyung Lee, or Daniel Lee. I usually go by mangoclient on most of my socials. 

This is my first web application project that I wanted to work on to help kickstart my javascript as well as touching up on my md langauges. 

A particular way that I wanted to display my resume was using a website to help showcase my projects, blogs, and research through a command-line/TERMINAL like style website.

I got my inspiration off of: https://fkcodes.com/
